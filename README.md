# Movie_Recommendation_System
This project is a machine learning-based movie recommendation system developed using Python. It helps users find movies similar to their preferences using content-based and collaborative filtering approaches. The system also utilizes K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recommend the top 5 most similar movies.
